# Titan CV Agent Benchmark

[[中文版]](README_CN.md)

**The Titan CV Benchmark is primarily designed to evaluate the performance of AGENTS in the field of computer vision (CV).** We have collected more than 200 test examples to comprehensively test the performance of the agent, particularly their capability to solve problems step by step.

## Basic principles

In order to distinguish the traditional benchmark of VLM, all collected samples will follow the following principles:

① **Diverse modalities**, including various types of images and videos, and **rich application domains** such as industry, medicine, agriculture, environment, society, culture, sports, and scientific research.

② Each problem will try to maintain its complexity, and **it cannot be solved in a single step** (e.g., using a VLM alone). Instead, it requires multi-step serial thinking.

③ Each problem will focus on the intelligence of the intelligent agent. **The problems should appear simple to humans but be complex for machines.** Except in the medical field, it can be easily understood by any inexperienced adult, but it needs to fully mobilize its thinking and cognitive abilities. **For machines, traditional advantages such as memorization, calculation, or speed are not helpful in solving these problems**, and they need spatial cognition or advanced understanding abilities similar to humans.

④ Each question is complex, but **the answer is simple and verifiable**, avoiding the ambiguity and complexity of open-ended question evaluation. If it is a question similar to the position difference, certain options will be given to avoid ambiguity, but at the same time, in order to prevent the intelligent agent from guessing the correct answer, the alternative answers are usually set to more than 6 to reduce the risk of guessing.
